 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis (Python + SQL + Power BI)
This project is a complete end-to-end Data Analytics Portfolio Project where I analyzed customer shopping patterns to uncover purchase behavior trends, customer segments, loyalty drivers, and revenue opportunities.
It follows a real-world analytics workflow used in modern companies — starting from raw data cleaning to business insights and dashboard storytelling.
✅ Skills used: Python • SQL • Power BI • Data Cleaning • EDA • KPI Building • Dashboarding • Business Insights
🎯 Why I Built This Project
I created this project to demonstrate how a Data Analyst works in a real business environment:
Turning raw customer data into meaningful insights
Writing SQL queries to answer business questions
Building a dashboard for decision-makers
Delivering recommendations that improve retention + revenue
📌 Project Objectives
This analysis helps answer questions like:
Who are the highest value customers?

🔍 Key Insights (Example Format)
(You will replace these with your actual results)
✅ Customers aged X–Y show highest purchase frequency
✅ Category A generates the maximum revenue share
✅ Repeat customers have higher AOV compared to one-time shoppers
✅ Discounts drive volume but reduce profit margin in certain categories
✅ Business Recommendations
📌 Based on the analysis, I recommend:
Target high-value customer segments with premium offers
Create loyalty benefits for repeat buyers
Bundle products in top categories for cross-sell
Improve marketing campaigns based on customer behavior patterns
📌 Future Improvements
